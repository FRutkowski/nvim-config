# Neovim configuration

This is my NeoVim config especially made for programming in Nuxt.js. It was important to me to create a configuration 
that provides features like treesitter, formatter, autopairs, linter or lsp. I have also added snippets from VSCode that allows easily create html elements.

# Installation

## Linux
Just copy repository content to ```~/.config/nvim```. Make sure you have ```neovim``` package installed.
