# Neovim configuration

This is my meovim config especially made for programming in Nuxt.js. It was important to me to create a configuration 
that provides IDE features like treesitter, formatter, autopairs, linter or lsp. I have also added snippets from VSCode that allows easily create html elements.
This configuration + vim keybindings is a very powerfull tool to create your own software.
